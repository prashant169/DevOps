Introduction
Embark on a journey into the world of containerization as we delve into the deployment of a robust MERN stack application using Docker and Docker Compose. In this blog post, we will explore two distinct approaches — Dockerfile and Docker-Compose — each bringing its own set of advantages to the deployment process.

GitHub Repository (Dockerfile Implementation)-Dockerfile-Project

GitHub Repository (Docker-Compose Implementation)-DockerCompose-Project

To deploy our application, we will use two approaches.

Dockerfile: According to our project, Dockerfile will help me to create images and containers but the issue you will see is that I need to provide the network for each application to communicate with each other.

Docker-Compose: While doing deployment using Docker-Compose, it will create the default network in which the container will be created. So, you don’t need to configure the network manually.

There are many more differences between Dockerfile & Docker-Compose. But today’s blog is dedicated to Project only. So, we won’t do that.
